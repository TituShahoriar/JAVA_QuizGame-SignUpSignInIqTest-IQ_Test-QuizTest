# JAVA_QuizGame-SignUpSignInIqTest-IQ_Test-QuizTest
Proposing a program that allows users to sign up and sign in using their name, username, email, and password. After signing in, the user can take a test and the program will show the results. This program can be implemented in Java using a graphical user interface (GUI).
I will design the user interface by deciding on the layout and components I want to include in my GUI such as text fields for entering user information, buttons for submitting information or taking the test, and labels for displaying results.

I will implement the user interface by using a GUI library such as Swing or JavaFX to create the components and layout I designed in step 1.

I will add functionality by writing code to handle user input such as validating user information when they sign up or sign in and storing their information in a database.

I will create the test by designing it and writing code to display it in the GUI.

I will calculate and display results by writing code to calculate the userâ€™s test results based on their answers and display them in the GUI.
